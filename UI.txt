GUI vs CLI They are similar in the fact that both use normal english to communicate information, they both also probably the 2 most common. CLI and GUI are often included together since GUI is just like CLI but is simplified and uses visuals. GUI is for the average person who doesn't need or want all the options of CLI. GUI is easier as all your options are stream lined with all the commands you would want to use commonly on CLI are made into button presses. CLI outclasses most if not all other interfaces as all possible options have a command you have to type but you need to memorize syntax. You can also multitask on a GUI while on CLI's you can only do 1 thing at a time since you only have 1 line in which you type your commands. GUI's also take advantage of short cuts so that working is optimized for efficiency. In CLI it is difficult to notice errors but in GUI errors can almost be completely eliminated. GUI take up more memory space so if you're in a pinch of memory and can't use anymore CLI could be your last resort. GUI is harder  to code so for newbies a CLI is more in their range for early developers. If i write another 50 words to meet the requirement it's just gunna be filler there's not alot to UI they are all pretty similar in what they do, they just do it in slightly different ways.
