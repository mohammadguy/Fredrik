Write up algorithms to exhaustively describe in text and pseudocode, 
steps to brush oneâ€™s teeth, eat an orange, and something you do everyday.

First you grab your tooth paste and remove the cap, then grab your tooth brush from the handle in the other hand, after that you squeeze the tube with varying intensity and position to apply a pea sized dot onto you toothbrush bristles. Then you put both the tooth brush and tooth paste down and put the cap back on the tooth paste container. Finally you pick the tooth brush from the handle back up, put the bristles side into your mouth and use the brussels as a way to spread tooth paste across all sides off your teeth and tongue.

if tooth paste on tooth brush bristles is less than one pea

use tooth brush bristles to apply tooth paste on all sides of teeth and tongue

First you grab the orange with one hand and use the other hand and thumb nail to puncture the thick peel. Once the orange peel is punctured use your thumb nail as a shovel to lift up the peel off the orange, once a portion of the peel is lifted off the surface of the orange you can go in a spiral up or down the orange continueling mimicing the action of a shovel with your nail or thumb to remove the rest of the peel. Once the peel is completely off you sepereate the slices of orange from where they naturally seperate themselves and put once slice in your mouth chew thoroughly and swallow, then repeat until all slices are swallowed.
